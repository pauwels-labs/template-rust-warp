      <h1>Highly Available</h1>
      <p>
	Highly-available software continues to run when it breaks.
      </p>
      <p>
	When software fails, and it inevitably always does, it can do so in one of three ways:
	<ol>
	  <li>
	    Quietly, without telling anyone, and with no immediately obvious problems.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Catastrophically, the code crashes, the computer shuts down, alarm bells ring.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Harmfully, by losing or destroying business-critical data.
	  </li>
	</ol>
      </p>
      <p>
	Frequently, these failure-modes are combined into failure-monstrosities. The most
	insidious failures do so quietly and harmfully, allowing the destruction to continue
	undetected for extended amounts of time until the error turns catastrophic. The best
	failures are simply catastrophic, because I can immediately see them and address them
	and data is unaffected. I attempt to address each failure-mode within
	the context of each decision point in the software development lifecycle.
      </p>
      <p>
	Quiet errors are addressed through proper language selection, pervasive use of tagged logging
	and application process monitoring, and alerting, to make any failure as loud as possible.
	I prefer to use languages that are inherently safer, like Rust, as their goal is to detect
	and call out as many errors as possible at compile time, before the code ever runs. Using
	tagged logging and APM I'm able to create dashboards that give live insight into running
	code, allowing me to answer questions like "what were the most common errors this month?" or
	"what was the full chain of events leading up this error?". Since this information is queryable,
	I can then connect alerting mechanisms which message or call me when anything seems out of the
	ordinary.
      </p>
      <p>
	Catastrophic errors are dealt with using smart infrastructure. All of my software is
	containerized and can be run across a broad variety of clouds or container orchestration
	tools. Almost all of these tools can be leveraged to detect crashed or frozen code and
	immediately restart it to avoid disruption to the users. Frequently, it's possible to have
	more than one instance of the code running to immediately take over in case the other
	crashes for uninterrupted service.
      </p>
      <p>
	Harmful failures can be partially prevented via conscientious development, but if we assume
	that they can and will happen, the most important step is to provide smooth recovery from
	them. All stored data is snapshotted on a daily basis with those snapshots kept on the
	short-term to minimize costs, with longer-term backups made less frequently and stored in
	cheaper storage. Potentially destructive operations are always authenticated to identify
	who performed them, and logged using whichever activity logging mechanisms are provided by the
	storage.
      </p>
      <p>
	I attempt to minimize the number of errors which could possibly happen at run-time, and when
	they still do, I provide intelligent recovery systems that reset the software to a working
	state automatically.
