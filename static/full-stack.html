      <h1>Full Stack</h1>
      <p>
	Full-stack development means all code work is done in-house.
      </p>
      <p>
	In a typical project, code is split into a back-end and front-end. The back-end is invisible
	to the user and provides the tools and logic necessary to act on your business data. The
	front-end is what the user sees, and provides the buttons and interfaces to operate the software.
	I can develop across both halves of the software development stack.
