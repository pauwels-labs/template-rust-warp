      <h1>Cloud</h1>
      <p>
	Cloud-ready software can be deployed anywhere at any time.
      </p>
      <p>
	Many organizations and projects have existing deployment preferences, typically due to existing
	use or legal obligations on where certain things have to be. I will always attempt to
	accomodate these preferences and build software which can primarily be hosted in your
	preferred location, and as a secondary goal, could potentially be removed and placed somewhere
	else in the long-term.
      </p>
      <p>
	I can also develop safe migration strategies for moving from one deployment strategy to another.
