      <h1>Expandable</h1>
      <p>
	Expandable software naturally lends itself to modification of its scope.
      </p>
      <p>
	When approaching a project, I believe that after the information-gathering
	phase is over and project requirements are well-established, it's important to take
	a step back and analyze, in a more general sense, what this software is doing.
      </p>
      <p>
	I then split the project into individual components of functionality which have a
	highly-defined set of inputs producing a well-known set of outputs. I identify the
	transports by which this information will pass, in which way these transports can
	scale and fail, and build a reusable public interface which responds to and on
	those transports.
      </p>
      <p>
	Developing in this way allows me to limit the impact of inevitable changes in
	scope or functionality to a small amount of code:
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    Additional functionality can be added as a new component without changing
	    existing code.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Changes to internal functionality of one component can be done without worry
	    of breaking another, as components assume no knowledge of each other's internals.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Changes to the public interface of one component is completed by allowing both
	    the old and new interfaces to exist side-by-side. Other components can be slowly
	    updated to match the new interface, and the old interface quietly phased out in
	    a version upgrade.
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </p>
      <p>
	I don't assume a project can be fully defined before I begin building it, preferring
	instead to build easily modifiable software that can be iterated upon.
