      <h1>Scalable</h1>
      <p>
	Scalable software works just as well whether one or one million people use it.
      </p>
      <p>
	Scalability is a first-class citizen in my development methodology. I focus on
	making small, stateless components which can be replicated out as many times
	as required to accomodate any arbitrary load. I pair this strategy with extensive
	knowledge on leveraging auto-scaling infrastructure via Kubernetes, serverless
	functions, or various other cloud-specific technologies.
