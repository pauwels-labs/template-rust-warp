      <h1>Full Service</h1>
      <p>
	Full-service development means my expertise extends beyond writing code.
      </p>
      <p>
	The actual writing of the code is only one part of the software development process.
	I can also deploy modern CICD pipelines, organize your devops process, support or modify
	existing systems, and fully manage the project lifecycle. I have extensive infrastructure
	experience and can recommend deployment strategies which best match the needs of your project
	and budget.
